            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the <br>
            use of significant indentation.[31] <br>
            <br>
            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), <br>
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
