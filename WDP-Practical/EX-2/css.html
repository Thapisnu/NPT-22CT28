        <h4>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document <br>
            written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone <br>
            technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br>
            <br>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can <br>
            improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable <br>
            multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition <br>
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
