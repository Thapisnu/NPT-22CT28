        <h4>
            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, <br>
            alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7%  of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, <br>
            [10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. <br>
            <br>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. <br>
            [11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, <br>
            and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data <br>
            structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
