        <h4>
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
            It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)<br>
            and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            <br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
